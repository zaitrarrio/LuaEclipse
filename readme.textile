h1. What is this project about ?

h2. Summary

p<>. LuaEclipse is a collection of plugins developed for the _Eclipse platform_ that together make an _IDE_ for the development of applications in the _Lua_ programming language. In this environment it's possible to edit Lua scripts with syntax highlight, besides the tools that the Eclipse platform provides. The main goal of the project is that new tools will be developed using the extension architecture that the Eclipse platform provides and that _LuaEclipse_ has available for extension of its capabilities.

h2. What is cool about it ?

p<>. _Lua Eclipse 2_ is built upon *Eclipse* and *DLTK*. "Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/ allow you add your own features if needed through _Ecplise plug-ins_. Furthermore, as it using DLTK, adding features an maintain them will be easier and faster. "DLTK":http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/ is comprised of a set of extensible frameworks designed to reduce the complexity of building full featured development environments for dynamic language.

h2. More informations about LuaEclipse 1.x

This is a forked repository. Have a look at
        "jasonsantos's LuaEclipse wiki":/jasonsantos/LuaEclipse
        for more information.
You can also browse the "official LuaEclipse site":http://luaeclipse.luaforge.net/, I'm not mentioned on it :s.

h1. Install LuaEclipse 2

h2. Prerequisites

As I'm writing, *LuaEclipse 2* is available for both _Linux_ and _Windows_. _OSX_ version is delayed due to a swt bug for 32/64bits. Anyway, to run it you, need *Eclipse 3.5*. In order to install *LuaEclipse 2*, you do also need to add some update sites and download some archives beforehand.

h3. Update site

* *EMF XSD 2.5* : "http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/":http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/

p. Open _Eclipse_ go to  __"Help >> Install new software"__ and __"Add"__ the previous link.

h3. Archives to download

* *DLTK 2* : "http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/dltk/downloads/drops/R2.0/S-2.0M5-201002011215/dltk-core-sdk-S-2.0M5-201002011215.zip":http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/dltk/downloads/drops/R2.0/S-2.0M5-201002011215/dltk-core-sdk-S-2.0M5-201002011215.zip
* *LuaEclipse 2* : "http://github.com/downloads/KINFOO/LuaEclipse/LuaEclipse_stable_2.0.zip":http://github.com/downloads/KINFOO/LuaEclipse/LuaEclipse_stable_2.0.zip

p. Unzip both of them on your file system, then open _Eclipse_ go to  __"Help >> Install new software"__ and __"Add"__ the folder just extracted from the archives as __"Local"__  ressources.

h2. Installation

p. Now you can install *LuaEclipse 2* as a regular _Eclipse_ component, using __'Help >> Install new software'__ . *Be careful*, you need to uncheck __'Group items by category'__ to see it.

h2. Open a Lua file

p. Just click on any  __".lua"__ file in your _Eclipse_ workspace.

h1. Road map

h2. What is LuaEclipse 2 targeting?

* Release a stable version as soon as "DLTK 2.0":http://www.eclipse.org/dltk/ is released
* Code assistance
* Code snippets
* Smart outline

h2. What are you up to?

Currently I'm working on the parser to improve code completion and its semantic. If you want to help you are welcome.

h1. Changelog

Sometimes, I'm wondering _"What is the status of this project?"_. I think this might be the same for you. So, in order to facilitate your understanding of what is happening in here, I try to trace my work.

h2. "Lua dev tools":http://github.com/KINFOO/luadevtools ( previous project )

h3. Initial import

p<>. The initial code import of _LuaEclipse 2_ is from another project merged with _LuaEclipse 2_ existing code. This project nicknamed "Lua dev tools":http://kinfoo.github.com/luadevtools/  was interesting because using DLTK. As using this interesting framework  was one of the technical aims of _LuaEclipse 2_ , "Lua dev tools":http://kinfoo.github.com/luadevtools/ was eligible. And as there is "another project called [_lua-devtools_]":http://github.com/norman/lua-devtools, it was clearer to change name.

h3. Project status

At that time "Lua dev tools":http://kinfoo.github.com/luadevtools/ already offers some interesting features and components, such as:
* A DLTK based parser
* Metalua code analysis
* An outline
* Cross platform ready
